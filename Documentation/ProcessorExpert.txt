                already stored in the HW FIFO will be lost.
   - uart0_SelectBaudRate -This method changes the channel communication speed (baud rate). This method is enabled only if the 
                user specifies a list of possible period settings at design time (see <Timing dialog box> - Runtime setting - 
                from a list of values). Each of these settings constitutes a _/mode/_ and Processor Expert assigns them a 
                _/mode identifier/_. The prescaler and compare values corresponding to each mode are calculated in design time. 
                The user may switch modes at runtime by referring to a mode identifier. No run-time calculations are performed, 
                all the calculations are performed at design time.
   - uart0_GetSelectedBaudRate -Returns the current selected baud rate ID. This method is enabled only if the user specifies a 
                list of possible period settings in design time (see <Timing dialog box> - Runtime setting - from a list of 
                values).

Module "TI100ms"   (component TI100ms)
   - TI100ms_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "TU1"       (component TimerUnit_LDD)
   - TU1_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and sets 
                interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the property <"Enable in init. code"> is set to 
                "yes" value then the device is also enabled (see the description of the <Enable> method). In this case the 
                <Enable> method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be called only once. Before the 
                second call of Init the <Deinit> must be called first.

Module "InnerFlash" (component FLASH_LDD)
   - InnerFlash_Init -Initializes the device. Allocates memory for the device data structure, allocates interrupt vectors and 
                sets interrupt priority, sets pin routing, sets timing, etc. If the "Enable in init. code" property is set to 
                "yes" (<Enabled in init. code>) value then the device is also enabled(see the description of the Enable() 
                method). In this case the Enable() method is not necessary and needn't to be generated. This method can be 
                called only once. Before the second call of Init() the Deinit() must be called first.
   - InnerFlash_Read -This method sets up a flash memory read operation. The operation itself is performing by defined batches 
                (property <Read batch size>) by periodical calling the component¡¯s Main method in the user application (higher 
                level OS service).
   - InnerFlash_Write -This method sets up a flash memory write operation. The operation itself is performing by defined 
                batches (tproperty <Write batch size>) by periodical calling the component¡¯s Main method in the user 
                application (higher level OS service) or by the component¡¯s ISR, if an component¡¯s interrupt service is enabled.
   - InnerFlash_Erase -This method sets up a flash memory erase operation. The operation itself is performing by defined 
                batches (property <Erase batch size>) by periodical calling the component¡¯s Main method in the user application 
                (higher level OS service) or by the component¡¯s ISR, if an component¡¯s interrupt service is enabled.
   - InnerFlash_Main -This method is used to perform one batch of a flash memory operation operation. This method is used to 
                perform batches of all flash memory operations (Write, Read, Erase, EraseBlock, VerifyErasedBlock) when the 
                component works in the polled mode (interrupt service is disabled - property <Interrupt service>). This method 
                performs batches of the read flash memory operation, when the component works in the interrupt triggered mode 
                (interrupt service is enabled). This method is enabled only if the component works in the polled mode or if the 
                Read method is enabled.
